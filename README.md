# Lagrange-oscillatory-neural-network
Matlab code simulating a Lagrange oscillatory neural network (LagONN) to solve the Max-3-SAT problem.
LagONN employs additional Lagrange oscillators to enforce constraint satisfaction. The phase dynamics seek a saddle point in the energy landscape where all constraints are satisfied.
